What are interrupts
===================

:Date: 10/07/2018

An interrupt is a device calling the kernel (a.k.a.
operating system). When an interrupt happens, the
processor saves what it was doing and executes a code at
a specific memory address. The kernel has put its code
there during its initialization, then it is called.
Interrupt is also known as IRQ (Interrupt ReQuest).

According to the source of the interrupt the kernel takes
a different action.

Interrupts are one of the most important concepts in
computers. They are responsible for efficient input
and output.
